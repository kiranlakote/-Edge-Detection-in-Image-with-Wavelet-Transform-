# -Edge-Detection-in-Image-with-Wavelet-Transform-
 The project aimed to extract the Edge of the Images using the wavelet filter such as sobel filter, which helps in extraction of the edges by the removing the noise and applying the contrast and then you might proceed to morphological operations like erosion and dilation and get a thin skeleton of the contour in the end.
